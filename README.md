> Udemy, course VueJS. Final Project - Stock Trader

*Started 22-06-2018, finished ..-06-2018*



Goal besides default course material

- Set up a more or less professional development environment.
- Take time to stray into related subjects, like linting, testing.
- Learn, learn, learn.

So, it may take a while to get momentum :-)



Initialized Vue project with template `webpack`. 

- Chose to include `unit` (Jest) and `e2e` (NightWatch) testing.
  - Learn syntax for both testers.
  - Try to keep tests up to date with development
  - Or TTD, keep development up to date with tests :-)
- Chose to include `ESLint` linting
  - Find out more about this
  - Code analysis, find problematic patterns, check code against style guidelines.
  - ./eslintrc.js, config file for ESLint

  - https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring



Created a git repository. Let's commit regularly to refresh git knowledge.



Took some time to get testing working. Jest had a warning intitally, deprecated option, removed it from `./tests/unit.jest.conf.js`.

Almost gave up on NightWatch, but got it running in the end. Only Oracle Java JDK needed to be installed.
